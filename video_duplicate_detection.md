# Video Duplicate Detection Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify duplicate video files (MP4 format) that have been resized and saved with the same filename in different folders. The solution will use an in-memory data structure approach for single-session analysis.

## Phase 1: Foundation and File Discovery

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 Directory Scanner Module
- **Objective**: Recursively scan multiple directories to discover all MP4 files
- **Output**: List of file paths with basic filesystem metadata
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Handles nested directory structures
  - Filters for MP4 files only
  - Captures file size, creation date, modification date
  - Robust error handling for inaccessible files/directories

#### 1.2 Core Data Structure Implementation
- **Objective**: Implement in-memory data containers for file metadata
- **Output**: Primary hash map and secondary indices structure
- **Success Criteria**:
  - File path as primary key with metadata object values
  - Filename grouping index for duplicate candidates
  - Duration and resolution indices for validation
  - Memory-efficient object design

#### 1.3 Basic File Inventory Report
- **Objective**: Generate summary statistics of discovered files
- **Output**: Console/text report of file counts, sizes, and distribution
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Total file count and cumulative size
  - Files grouped by directory
  - Filename collision report (same names in different folders)

## Phase 2: Video Metadata Extraction

### Deliverables

#### 2.1 Video Metadata Parser
- **Objective**: Extract technical video properties from MP4 files
- **Output**: Enhanced metadata objects with video-specific attributes
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Duration extraction (seconds with millisecond precision)
  - Resolution detection (width x height)
  - Frame rate and frame count calculation
  - Codec information capture
  - Graceful handling of corrupted/invalid files

#### 2.2 Metadata Validation System
- **Objective**: Verify extracted metadata quality and consistency
- **Output**: Validation report and flagged problematic files
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Detect files with missing or invalid metadata
  - Flag unusually short/long durations
  - Identify non-standard resolutions or frame rates
  - Generate data quality metrics

#### 2.3 Enhanced File Inventory
- **Objective**: Updated inventory with video technical details
- **Output**: Comprehensive report including video properties
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Resolution distribution analysis
  - Duration range statistics
  - Codec usage summary
  - File quality assessment

## Phase 3: Duplicate Detection Engine

### Deliverables

#### 3.1 Candidate Identification Algorithm
- **Objective**: Identify files that could potentially be duplicates
- **Output**: Groups of files suspected to be related
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Group files by identical filename
  - Filter groups by matching duration (Â±1 second tolerance)
  - Rank groups by confidence level
  - Handle edge cases (multiple resolutions, partial matches)

#### 3.2 Duplicate Validation System
- **Objective**: Verify suspected duplicates using multiple criteria
- **Output**: Confirmed duplicate relationships with confidence scores
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Aspect ratio consistency verification
  - Timestamp analysis (creation/modification dates)
  - File size correlation analysis
  - Bitrate comparison for resolution validation

#### 3.3 Relationship Mapping
- **Objective**: Establish parent-child relationships between originals and duplicates
- **Output**: Data structure linking originals to their resized copies
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Identify likely original (highest resolution, earliest timestamp)
  - Map duplicates to their suspected originals
  - Handle complex scenarios (multiple resolution variants)
  - Confidence scoring for each relationship

## Phase 4: Analysis and Reporting

### Deliverables

#### 4.1 Duplicate Analysis Report
- **Objective**: Generate comprehensive duplicate detection results
- **Output**: Detailed report of all identified duplicates
- **Success Criteria**:
  - List of confirmed duplicate groups
  - Original vs. duplicate classification
  - File size savings potential
  - Confidence levels for each detection

#### 4.2 Edge Case Handler
- **Objective**: Process and report unusual or problematic cases
- **Output**: Manual review queue for ambiguous cases
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Flag files with identical names but different content
  - Identify incomplete or corrupted duplicate sets
  - Report multiple resolution chains
  - Highlight low-confidence matches requiring human review

#### 4.3 Action Recommendation Engine
- **Objective**: Suggest actions for each duplicate group
- **Output**: Recommended actions with risk assessment
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Safe-to-delete recommendations
  - Files requiring manual verification
  - Preservation recommendations for originals
  - Batch operation suggestions

- **Output**: Comprehensive error management system
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Graceful handling of corrupted files
  - Recovery from filesystem access errors
  - Detailed error logging and reporting
  - Partial result preservation on failure

#### 5.3 Configuration and Customization
- **Objective**: Make the solution configurable for different use cases
- **Output**: Configuration system with user-defined parameters
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Adjustable tolerance levels (duration, file size)
  - Configurable confidence thresholds
  - Custom output formats
  - Directory inclusion/exclusion rules

## Success Criteria and Testing

### Overall Project Success Metrics
- Successfully identify 95%+ of actual duplicates with <5% false positives
- Process 10,000+ files within reasonable time constraints
- Handle edge cases gracefully without crashes
- Provide actionable results for cleanup operations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests with sample datasets
- Performance testing with large file collections
- Edge case testing with problematic files

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Large dataset memory usage**: Implement streaming processing if needed
- **Corrupted file handling**: Robust error handling and skip mechanisms
- **False positive detection**: Multiple validation criteria and confidence scoring

### Operational Risks
- **Accidental data loss**: Read-only analysis mode, clear action recommendations
- **Performance degradation**: Configurable processing limits and progress tracking
