   - Prioritize duration similarity in confidence scoring, especially for exact matches.

2. **Handle Resolution Scaling Flexibility**:
   - Allow for more flexibility in resolution scaling patterns, including portrait vs. landscape resolutions.

3. **Aspect Ratio Tolerance**:
   - Add tolerance for aspect ratio mismatches, as they may not always indicate different content.

4. **File Size Tolerance**:
   - Increase tolerance for file size discrepancies, accounting for varying compression methods.

5. **Metadata Weighting**:
   - Adjust metadata weighting to prioritize duration and resolution over other factors.

### Edge Case Handling
1. **Improve Handling of Missing Metadata**:
   - Skip files with missing metadata during duplicate detection and validation.

2. **Refine Validation Results**:
   - Ensure validation results are correctly populated and accessible for all duplicates.

3. **Enhance Resolution Chain Analysis**:
   - Improve logic for analyzing resolution chains to detect inconsistencies and missing common ratios.

### Action Recommendations
1. **Adjust Recommendations for Aspect Ratio Mismatches**:
   - Recommend manual review for aspect ratio mismatches instead of verification.

2. **Improve Confidence Thresholds**:
   - Refine confidence thresholds for safe deletion and verification actions.

3. **Add Detailed Reasoning**:
   - Provide more detailed reasoning for each action recommendation to improve transparency.

### Testing and Debugging
1. **Add Comprehensive Test Cases**:
   - Include test cases for edge scenarios such as missing metadata, unusual aspect ratios, and inconsistent resolution chains.

2. **Verify Metadata Extraction**:
   - Ensure metadata extraction works correctly for all video files, including edge cases.

3. **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Test the application with real-world data to validate its effectiveness and accuracy.

### Performance Optimization
1. **Optimize Metadata Validation**:
   - Improve efficiency of metadata validation checks to handle large datasets.

2. **Parallelize Duplicate Detection**:
   - Implement parallel processing for duplicate detection to speed up analysis.

3. **Reduce Memory Usage**:
   - Optimize data structures to reduce memory usage during analysis.

These improvements aim to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and performance of the video duplicate detection tool.
